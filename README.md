# Movie_Recommendation_System

## ABSTRACT 

This analysis mainly focuses on the domain of Machine Learning example of Movie
Recommendation System with a approach of finding the similarity scores between the two
contents in the content based filtering. It helps us in finding the distance between the two
vectors and their angle by the help of the cosine similarity formula and their magnitude of
relative scores. In this model, we have considered two texts and plotted them in the form of a
graph from where we have plotted the points taking two-dimension plane of x-y plane only.
We have taken in consideration two fields (i.e.) in x-plane we have considered the word London
of the text whereas in y-plane we have considered Paris word of the texts. This model analysis
the points to find the two texts similarity scores by using Python shell and distance between
two vector model approach more effectively and precisely.

Many of the recommendation systems we are seeing today in our environment such as in the
YouTube for example if I see lots of news regarding the GK and Current Affairs then it offers
me the related videos according to it with different subscribers. It gains popularity by
application rating and at the same time enhances the customer experience. This policy of
recommendation system is really helpful in giving optimum results to an application
profitability and to make the organisation more connected.

## INTRODUCTION

Supervised Machine Learning is when the model is getting trained on a labelled
dataset. Labelled dataset is one which have both input and output parameters. In this
type of learning both training and validation datasets are labelled Here, we have three
components such as Training Data, Test Data and features. Training data is that where
data is usually split in the ratio of 80:20 i.e. 80% as training data and rest as testing
data. Testing data is that when data is good to be tested. At the time of testing, input is
fed from remaining 20% data which the model has never seen before, the model will
predict some value and we will compare it with actual output and calculate the
accuracy.
